# Leap-Motion-Pointers
A python 2.7 game aiming to teach about pointers using the Leap Motion controller

Code is generated in the box on the left according to how the boxes are connected on the screen.<br/>
The following operations can be performed:
* Pinch to drag boxes.
* Drag a box to the edge of the interaction area to delete it.
* Pinch and drag an arrow onto another box – onto the value to perform a value assignment, or onto the label to create a pointer to the other box.
* Tap on the “Add Var” button to add another variable box.
* Tap on the “Exit” button to exit the program.

Requires:
* Python 2.7
* VPython 6.11 (64 bit) (http://vpython.org)
* Leap Motion V2 Drivers (https://www.leapmotion.com/setup)
